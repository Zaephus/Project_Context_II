  dialogue: 'The ground in the southeastern area of the city contains a high amount
    of silt, which over time can shift under heavy loads.

    I would advise against
    building a large structure in that area. Silt looks similar to sand, but it is
    distinguished by its slightly darker color.

    Keep that in mind while planning.

    Thank
    you for preserving our beautiful planet!'
